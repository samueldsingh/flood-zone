As part of a greater stormwater mitigation project taken on by the university, you have been tasked to identify the FEMA Flood Zones that are located on or nearby campus property. 
1) I was tasked to create a professional-quality map of FSUâ€™s campus that utilized base map and also depicted FEMA flood zones overlayed.
2) I had create an Elevation Map of Tallahassee using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Tallahassee City Limits.
3) Used vector data from Tallahassee city website - https://tlcgis.org/ and Digital Elevation Model from USGS (https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) to create the Flood Zone and elevation map.
4) To create elevation map, I symbolized the DEM data using hypsometric tinting - which is the standard way to symbolize elevation.
